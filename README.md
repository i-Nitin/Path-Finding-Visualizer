# Path-Finding-Visualizer
Developed a Pathfinding Visualizer that gives the visual representation of the shortest path from source to destination
with some obstacles in a grid using multiple shortest path algorithms.
Provided users the interface through which they can visualize the shortest path from source to destination through
Breadth - First Search, Dijkstra's and A* Search Algorithms which are implemented in Javascript.
